# Welcome to My Blog!

After years of building software solutions across different domains - from healthcare EMR systems to cloud-based applications - I've decided to start sharing my experiences and insights through this blog.

## My Journey So Far

My path into software engineering has been quite unique. I started with a strong foundation in languages and literature, earning my MA from Syracuse University and even serving as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Argentina. But my passion for technology eventually led me to pursue full-stack web development through Acámica, and I haven't looked back since.

Currently, I'm working as an Associate Software Engineer at Allata, where I build cloud-based solutions using React, Node.js, and .NET. Recently, I had the opportunity to serve as Head of Technology at Adam HRS, where I designed and built a complete EMR platform from the ground up, integrating AI capabilities using AWS Bedrock.

## What to Expect on This Blog

I plan to share insights about:

- **Fullstack Development**: Real-world experiences with React, Node.js, and .NET
- **Cloud Architecture**: AWS and Azure solutions and best practices  
- **Healthcare Technology**: Lessons learned building EMR systems and healthcare software
- **AI Integration**: Practical applications of AWS Bedrock and other AI services
- **Remote Work**: Tips for working effectively in distributed teams
- **Career Transitions**: From academia to tech, and lessons learned along the way

## Why I'm Writing

Working remotely from Córdoba, Argentina with teams across different time zones has taught me the value of clear communication and documentation. This blog is an extension of that - a way to document my learning journey and hopefully help other developers facing similar challenges.

Whether you're a fellow .NET developer, someone interested in cloud architecture, or just curious about the intersection of AI and healthcare technology, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with other developers and learning from different perspectives. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/andrewscheuer) or check out my work experience in my [CV section](/cv/).

Thanks for stopping by, and welcome to my corner of the web!
