*Welcome to my developer journey!*

After years of building software solutions across different domains - from healthcare EMR systems to cloud-based applications - I've decided to start sharing my experiences and insights through this blog.

## <i class="fas fa-route"></i> My Journey So Far

My path into software engineering has been quite unique. I started with a strong foundation in languages and literature, earning my MA from Syracuse University and even serving as a **<i class="fas fa-award"></i> Fulbright English Teaching Assistant** in Argentina. But my passion for technology eventually led me to pursue full-stack web development through Acámica, and I haven't looked back since.

Currently, I'm working as an Associate Software Engineer at **<i class="fas fa-building"></i> Allata**, where I build cloud-based solutions using React, Node.js, and .NET. Recently, I had the opportunity to serve as Head of Technology at **<i class="fas fa-hospital"></i> Adam HRS**, where I designed and built a complete EMR platform from the ground up, integrating AI capabilities using AWS Bedrock.

## <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> What to Expect on This Blog

I plan to share insights about:

- **<i class="fas fa-code"></i> Fullstack Development**: Real-world experiences with React, Node.js, and .NET
- **<i class="fas fa-cloud"></i> Cloud Architecture**: AWS and Azure solutions and best practices  
- **<i class="fas fa-heart-pulse"></i> Healthcare Technology**: Lessons learned building EMR systems and healthcare software
- **<i class="fas fa-brain"></i> AI Integration**: Practical applications of AWS Bedrock and other AI services
- **<i class="fas fa-users"></i> Remote Work**: Tips for working effectively in distributed teams
- **<i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Career Transitions**: From academia to tech, and lessons learned along the way

## <i class="fas fa-pen"></i> Why I'm Writing

Working remotely from <i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> Córdoba, Argentina with teams across different time zones has taught me the value of clear communication and documentation. This blog is an extension of that - a way to document my learning journey and hopefully help other developers facing similar challenges.

Whether you're a fellow .NET developer, someone interested in cloud architecture, or just curious about the intersection of AI and healthcare technology, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

## <i class="fas fa-handshake"></i> Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with other developers and learning from different perspectives. Feel free to reach out via [<i class="fas fa-envelope"></i> email](mailto:aj.scheuer2@gmail.com) or connect with me on [<i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i> LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/andrewscheuer).

Thanks for stopping by, and welcome to my corner of the web!
