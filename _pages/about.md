# About Me

I'm a Software Engineer who loves building things that matter. Currently working at Allata, I specialize in fullstack development with React, Node.js, and .NET, focusing on cloud-based solutions that solve real problems.

## My Journey

My path to software engineering has been unconventional. I started with a strong foundation in languages and literature, earning my MA from Syracuse University and serving as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Argentina. But technology called to me, leading me to pursue full-stack development through Ac치mica.

Recently, I had the opportunity to serve as Head of Technology at Adam HRS, where I designed and built a complete EMR platform from the ground up, integrating AI capabilities using AWS Bedrock for intelligent healthcare workflows.

## Life in C칩rdoba

Based in C칩rdoba, Argentina, I work with remote teams across different time zones. This experience has taught me the value of clear communication, cultural sensitivity, and building strong relationships across distances.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the intersection of technology and human connection, always learning something new.
